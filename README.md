# Project 0 - Portfolio Website

For this project, I decided to create a personal portfolio to display some of my work, and the projects I've worked on.

## File Descriptions
- **Index.html:** My main home page displaying words that describe me by means of a Javascript typewriter effect
- **Navbar.html:** Contains code specifically for my navigation bar, so that I do not have to copy and paste it into each web page file
- **<Project_Name>.html:** I have multiple project pages describing the specific project work I've done, along with descriptions of skills involved and photos
- **Style.css/Style.scss:** Contains most of the stylings for my entire project
- **Typed.js:** An imported Javascript library I used for my home page typewriter effect
